# -Exploratory-Data-Analysis-for-Bank-Loan-Defaulters

Problem Statement:

This case study aims to identify patterns which indicate if an applicant has difficulty in paying his/her installments which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc. This will ensure that the consumers capable of repaying the loan are not rejected and the number of defaulters is also reduced.

Bank wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The bank can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

Datasets:

1. ‘application_data.csv’ contains all the information of the client at the time of application.
The data is about whether a applicant has payment difficulties.

2. ‘previous_application.csv’ contains information about the applicant’s previous loan data. It contains the data whether the previous application had been Approved, Cancelled, Refused or Unused offer.
